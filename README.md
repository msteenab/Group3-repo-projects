# Overview
This collaborative project involves team members designing a series of Python-based labs centered around various software testing techniques. These labs emphasize code creation, comprehensive documentation, and thorough evaluation. Topics covered range from web automation using Selenium and Playwright to best practices in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD). Additionally, the project entails creating a Requirements Traceability Matrix for specified documents, including SRS, HLD, LLD, and Test Plan. Below are the different branches composed of the following labs:

1. [Selenium](https://github.com/CbarNC/Group3-repo-projects/tree/Selenium)
2. [Behavior-Driven Development](https://github.com/CbarNC/Group3-repo-projects/tree/Behavior-Driven-Development-(BDD)) 
3. [Test-Driven Development](https://github.com/CbarNC/Group3-repo-projects/tree/Test-Driven-Development---(TDD)) 
4. [API Testing](https://github.com/CbarNC/Group3-repo-projects/tree/API-Testing) 
5. [Playwright](https://github.com/CbarNC/Group3-repo-projects/tree/Playwright)

## The Idea
Our initial idea was to create a restaurant website that has the following pages:

- Home
- About
- Menu
- Sign in
- Sign up

Users have an option to:
- Log in
- Sign up
- Leave contact feedback
- Choose from a list of different dishes we provide

## User Stories 
-	As a customer, I want to be able to create an account, so I can save my delivery address, order details, and payment information for future orders.
-	As a customer, I want to browse the restaurant's menu, view item details, and see prices, so I can decide what to order.
-	As a customer, I want to add items to my cart, adjust quantities, and see the total cost of my order, so I can confirm my selection before placing an order.
-	As a customer, I want to be able to apply promo codes or discounts to my order, so I can save money on my meals.
-	As a customer, I want to rate and review the restaurant and the food after my order is delivered, so I can share my experience with others.
-	As a customer, I want the option to reorder a previously placed order, saving me time on subsequent visits.

# Flowchart (Flow of Events)
Below is a flowchart we created to demonstrate the flow of events within our website:
